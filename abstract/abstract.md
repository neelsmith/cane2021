Rationale for the Panel.  Neel Smith, College of the Holy Cross (moderator and discussant)

Dionysius of Thrace's treatise entitled *Technê grammatikê* ("The art of the scholar of letters") is the earliest surviving Greek grammatical work.  While the transmission of the text has greatly altered its original form, there is broad consensus that the opening definition of the six components of the art of literary interpretation reflect Dionysius' own views.

We are motivated to revisit Dionysius' work by the recent digital publication by the Homer Multitext project of more than 9,000 *scholia* to the *Iliad* in the Venetus A manuscript. The most frequent proper name in the *scholia* is that of Dionysius' teacher and the foremost ancient editor of Homer, Aristarchus of Samothrace.  The three papers in this

My research explores the overlap between the literary-critical interests of Dionysius Thrax and the scribe of the Venetus A manuscript. In his Τέχνη γραμματική, Dionysius Thrax establishes six steps for understanding a text thoroughly. The scholiast of the Venetus A may not list his interests as concisely, but he did distinguish his literary-critical vocabulary by presenting them as verbal adjectives ending in -τεον. These verbal adjectives work similarly to Dionysius' explicit rules, explaining what the scholiast thought he or his readers must do in order to understand the text fully. In order to organize these verbal adjectives, which are spread throughout the scholia, into a more concise form which would be comparable to Dionysius' list, I will use topic models of the verbal adjectives and the words with which they appear the most frequently. This method creates 'topics,' or clusters of co-occuring words with no inherent meaning, but to which we can ascribe meaning based on relation between the words. By analyzing how closely the words in each topic align with the categories of literary-critical understanding layed out by Dionysius Thrax, I will determine to what extent his view of his own craft aligned with the view of the Venetus A scholiast.

The purpose of our research is to examine the stories, characters, and authors preserved in the scholia of Iliad manuscripts. The scholia that are most important for this research are those containing variants of the words ἱστορέω and ἱστορία, as these appear when the scholiast wishes to provide a backstory concerning the text. We are interested in how the authors cited in these chronologically relate to the Homeric scholar Aristarchus. It appears that the pre-Aristarchan authors come from a variety of backgrounds while those who come after seem to chiefly be attached to mythology, particularly concerning the Trojan War. While ἱστορία scholia appear throughout the entire text, a significant number appear in Books I and II to provide context for the overall story. However, we have not found any detailing what happens after the story concludes, reinforcing that the scholia’s chief function is to help the reader understand the Iliad itself and anything that occurs after is the responsibility of a separate work to cover.

Aristonicus’ critical signs as outlined and described at the beginning of the Venetus A manuscript of Homer’s Iliad focus the reader’s attention on textual and literary matters, such as whether specific lines should be considered “Homeric,” based on such criteria as various types of “appropriateness.”  For example, a line that occurs in more than one location is argued to be better suited to its dramatic context in one place rather than in another.  Two centuries earlier, the grammarian Dionysius Thrax had given a six-fold division of the art of literary interpretation, of which the sixth and (according to him) most important part is the “critical judgment of poetry”; in this panel we examine possible connections between the literary systems used and described by these two scholars.
