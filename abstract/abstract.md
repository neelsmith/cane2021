Rationale for the Panel:  Neel Smith, College of the Holy Cross (moderator and discussant)

Dionysius of Thrace's treatise *Technê grammatikê* ("The art of the scholar of letters") is the earliest surviving Greek grammatical work.  While the transmission of the text has greatly altered its original form, there is broad consensus that the opening definition of the six components of the art of literary interpretation reflects Dionysius' own views.

We are motivated to revisit Dionysius' definition by the Homer Multitext project's recent  publication of more than 9,000 *scholia* in the Venetus A manuscript of the *Iliad*.  These notes offer unique insight into the work of ancient grammarians, especially of Dionysius' teacher and the foremost ancient editor of Homer, Aristarchus of Samothrace.

The three papers in this panel draw on different aspects of the Homer Multitext project's digital editions to explore how the *scholia* inform us about the art of the scholar of letters.

Dionysius names as one component of the literary scholar's work the "ready accounting for ἱστορίαι," that is, the "back stories" that the Homeric reader is supposed to know.  A survey of the sources cited by *scholia* using the terms ἱστορέω or ἱστορία shows that they draw on a wide range of sources earlier in date than Aristarchus, but only cite stories from later sources that are specifically focused on mythology or the Trojan War.  T*his reflects a progressive narrowing of scholarly disussion to a canonical set of versions.

We also see that while ἱστορία scholia appear throughout the entire text, a significant number appear in Books 1 and 2 to provide context for the overall story. The ἱστορία scholia do not discuss events after the conclusion of the *Iliad*.  As we will show with specific examples, this illustrates how the "ready accounting for ἱστορίαι" serves the grammarian's larger aim of evaluating authentically Homeric material.

This paper explores a previously unstudied aspect of the technical language of the *scholia*.  The *scholia* use the verbal adjective ending in -τέον when referring to necessary or obligatory aspects of the scholar's work.  I first show that when it is not referring to action in the story of the *Iliad*, this verbal adjective is used exclusively for the technical tasks of the *grammatikos*.   That is, we can view the verbal adjective similarly to Dionysius' explicit rules, explaining what the scholiast thought he or his readers must do in order to understand the text fully.

I then compare the activities described by this verb form with Dionysius' six parts of the scholar's art.  While some terms correspond precisely to a single category, others describe actions that could apply to more than one of Dionysius' concerns.  I use topic modelling to identify 'topics' within the scholia, that is clusters of co-occuring words with no inherent meaning, but to which we can ascribe meaning based on relation between the words.

By analyzing how closely distinct topics align with the categories of literary-critical understanding layed out by Dionysius Thrax, we can see how the practice of commentary preserved in the *scholia* corresponds to the systematic definitoin of Dionysius.

The *Iliad* text of the Venetus A manuscript uniquely preserves a system of annotation with critical signs that was invented by Dionysius' teacher, Aristarchus, and is our only source for a fragment of the treatise *On Critical Signs* by Aristonicus.  As this fragment shows, the critical signs focus the reader’s attention on textual and literary matters, such as whether specific lines should be considered "Homeric," based on such criteria as various types of "appropriateness." They allow us to see how the editorial work of Aristarchus was directed toward the ultimate goal of the literary scholar according to Dionysius, namely the "critical judgment of poetry."
